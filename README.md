### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**DracoVault/DracoVault** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c/c++
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing 
- ğŸ“« best way to reach me is to email me 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him 
- âš¡ Fun fact: i dont like coding at all
